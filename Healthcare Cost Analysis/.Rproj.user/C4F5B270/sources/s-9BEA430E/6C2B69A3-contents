# DESCRIPTION
# Background and Objective:
#   A nationwide survey of hospital costs conducted by the US Agency for 
#   Healthcare consists of hospital records of inpatient samples. 
#   The given data is restricted to the city of Wisconsin and relates 
#   to patients in the age group 0-17 years. The agency wants to analyze 
#   the data to research on healthcare costs and their utilization.
# Domain: Healthcare

#Let's Clean up Global Environment

# Load Dataset

hc_cost <- read.csv("HospitalCosts.csv")
head(hc_cost)

# Analysis to be done:

# 1. To record the patient statistics, the agency wants to find the age 
#    category of people who frequent the hospital and has the maximum 
#    expenditure.

# Code 
# Data Analysis and Preprocessing 
summary(hc_cost)

str(hc_cost)

summary(as.factor(hc_cost$AGE))

# Result: We can see that infants (AGE = 0) have the maximum 
# frequency of hospital visit, going above 300. we can see that 
# there are 306 entries for those in the range of 0-1 year.

# To find the age category with the maximum expenditure

# Age TotChgAge

library(dplyr)
df_AGE <- summarise(group_by(hc_cost, AGE), TotChgAge = sum(TOTCHG))
df_AGE

arrange(df_AGE, desc(TotChgAge))

arrange(df_AGE, desc(TotChgAge))[1,] # 1st row``

# OUTPUT

# Result: From the result we can see that the infant category (AGE = 0) has maximum hospital costs 
# as well (in accordance with the number or frequency of visit). 

# 2. In order of severity of the diagnosis and treatments and to find out 
#    the expensive treatments, the agency wants to find the diagnosis-
#    related group that has maximum hospitalization and expenditure.

# Code

df_APRDRG <- summarise(group_by(hc_cost,APRDRG), TotChgAPRDRG = sum(TOTCHG))
df_APRDRG

summary(as.factor(hc_cost$APRDRG))

# OUTPUT
# Result: We can see that DIAGONSIS-RELATED group 640 have the maximum 
# frequency of hospital visit, we can see that there are 266 entries.

arrange(df_APRDRG, desc(TotChgAPRDRG))
arrange(df_APRDRG, desc(TotChgAPRDRG))[1,] # 1st row

# OUTPUT

# Result: From the result we can see that the DIAGNOSIS-GROUP 640 has 
#         maximum hospital costs as well 
#         (in accordance with the number or frequency of visit AND expenditure).

# 3. To make sure that there is no malpractice, the agency needs to analyze 
#    if the race of the patient is related to the hospitalization costs.

# If there is any effect of RACE on TOTCHG

# Then, to verify if the races made an impact on the costs, perform an ANOVA with the 
# following variables:  

# ANOVA dependent variable: TOTCHG 
# Categorical/grouping variable: RACE Missing values: 1 NA value, use na.omit 
# to remove the NA value   
# 

# Code:  

str(hc_cost$RACE)
str(hc_cost$TOTCHG)

model3 <- aov(TOTCHG ~ RACE, data = hc_cost)  # numerical/int ~ categorical varibale

# dependent variable ~ independent variable

summary(model3)

alpha = 0.05

pvalue = 0.943

pvalue < alpha 

# OUTPUT
#     We get FALSE So, There is no malpractice, the agency analyzed 
#     race of the patient, which is not related to the hospitalization costs.

# if this is true = whenever p_value is less than alpha; we reject the null hypothesis

# 4. To properly utilize the costs, the agency has to analyze the severity of 
#    the hospital costs by age and gender for the proper allocation of resources.

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# ANOVA is used to test relationship between one quantitative and one or 
# more qualitative variable.

str(hc_cost$AGE)
str(hc_cost$FEMALE)

model4 <- aov(TOTCHG ~ AGE + FEMALE, data = hc_cost)

summary(model4)

alpha = 0.05

pvalue_Age = 0.00323
pvalue_Gender = 0.03638

pvalue_Age < alpha 
pvalue_Gender < alpha

# OUTPUT
# 1. pvalue_Age is very less this means it is a important factor in the 
#    hospital costs as seen by the significance levels
# 2. pvalue_Gender is also very less this means it is a important factor in 
#    the hospital costs as seen by the significance levels and same 
#    with allocation of resource.


# 5. Since the length of stay is the crucial factor for inpatients, the agency 
#    wants to find if the length of stay can be predicted from age, gender, and race.

# Since the length of stay is a continuous variable, we use linear regression to 
# predict the variable.  

# Dependent variable: LOS ;; Independent variables: AGE, FEMALE, RACE

# length of stay can be predicted from age, female, and race.

Model5 <- lm(LOS ~ AGE + FEMALE + RACE, data = hc_cost)
summary(Model5)

#OUTPUT
# The significance codes are almost null for all the variables, except for the 
# intercept. The p-value high which signifies that there is no linear 
# relationship between the given variables.Hence we cannot predict the length of 
# stay of the patients based on the age, gender, and race.


# 6. To perform a complete analysis, the agency wants to find the variable that 
#    mainly affects hospital costs.

model6 <- lm(TOTCHG ~ ., data = hc_cost)
summary(model6)

# Based on the output we can see that the Age and Length of stay affects the 
# total Hospital cost. Cost is directly proportional to the Length 
# i.e. higher the Length of stay of patients will result to higher hospital cost. 
# As per the output we can see that with an increase of 1 day stay, 
# the hospital cost will increase by 742.
